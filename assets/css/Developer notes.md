# User story

As a ____, I want to ____ so that I can ____ .

This is what we need to get done, this is how we'll break it down 

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
 1. Who is your target audience?
 2. What is the problem that the product will address?
 3. What is the primary goal of the product?
 4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

 1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
 2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
 3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people’s images so that I can keep up with what’s happening in their lives.

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren’t essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.

# Student Do: GitHub Issues

* In this activity you will create an Issue on GitHub utilizing the template provided.

## Instructions

* Start by listing the tasks involved in completing each of your user stories.

* Once you have 1-5 tasks written up for each user story, open a GitHub issue for each task by clicking on `Issues` and the green `New Issue` button.

Use the template below, replacing the user stories and acceptance criteria with your own.

```## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to input search queries so that I can search Stack Overflow when I'm stuck.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] index.html has a text input
- [ ] index.html has a search button
```

**This is a critical task.** Don’t be afraid to ask instructional staff for help during this part. Make sure that each task is clear and everyone on the team understands how to implement each one.

As an example:

In a dating website application...

**User Story**: As a user I want to see my closest match, so that I can meet someone with whom I share interests.

* **BAD TASK**: 
1. On new member form submit, find and display best match.

* **GOOD TASKS**: 
1. build a form that captures user scores (1-5) to ten questions. 
2. On submit, save the ten numerical answers to as an array.
3. Compare the user array to each existing user array and find the closest match.
4. Display the closest match to the user.
